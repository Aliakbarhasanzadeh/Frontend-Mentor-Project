# Frontend Mentor Projects

This repository contains all of my solutions to challenges from **Frontend Mentor**.

I use Frontend Mentor to improve my front-end skills by building real-world projects and practicing modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript workflows.
Each project focuses on clean code, responsive layouts, and best practices.
